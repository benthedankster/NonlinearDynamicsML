This serves as a proof of concept for the use of multiple time series data transformed into the frequency domain for use in deep neural networks.
It contains a randomly generated M/C/K system bouncing against a second spring some distance away.

NOTE: "MCK Toy Model.ipynb" IS OUTDATED! See fixed model in "Frequency Analysis.ipynb"
